Prerequisites
======================================

The only technical prerequisites are the dependencies and, of course, `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ itself. The unique knowledge prerequisite is a basic Python language understanding. If you never worked with Python before and for some reason ended up here, it is highly recommended to read `Python's official Beginner's Guide to Python <https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide>`_ before starting with this package.


Although ipeadatapy can be run in any kind of Python environment, since the package is all about data, it is recommended, for a better experience, to work with a notebook style interactive interpreter. The more convenient recommendation is to use `Jupyter Notebook <https://jupyter.org>`__. Jupyter Notebook is a web application for creating Jupyter notebooks. A Jupyter notebook is a JSON document containing an ordered list of input/output cells which can contain code, text, mathematics, plots and rich media. Jupyter notebooks can be converted to a number of open standard output formats (HTML, HTML presentation slides, LaTeX, PDF, ReStructuredText, Markdown, Python) through 'Download As' in the web interface and jupyter convert in a shell.
